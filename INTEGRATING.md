Grafana Agent Charmed Operator can be integrated with other charms through the following relations.

## Provides

### Logging provider

#### This charm

```yaml
provides:
  logging-provider:
    interface: loki_push_api
```


#### Remote charm

```yaml
requires:
  logging:
    interface: loki_push_api
```

Using this relation, Grafana Agent Charmed Operator can receive logs from any charm that supports the [`loki_push_api`](https://charmhub.io/loki-k8s/libraries/loki_push_api) relation interface (Those logs will later be forwarded to Loki using the `logging-consumer` relation).


The information exchanged through the `loki_push_api` interface can be broken down into two parts:

  - Grafana Agent charm provides an [endpoint URL](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/api/#post-lokiapiv1push) to receive logs from charms running [Loki clients](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/).
  - Grafana Agent charm may also receive alert rules which tell it when to raise alerts. These rules are read from a directory named `loki_alert_rules`, if present at the top level, within the client charm's source (`src`) directory.


For instance let's say that we need [Zinc Charmed Operator](https://charmhub.io/zinc-k8s) to send logs to Grafana Agent.
To do that we can use one of the "consumer" objects offered by the `loki_push_api` lib and follow these steps.

1. Specify the relation in the charm's metadata.yaml:

```yaml
requires:
  logging:
    interface: loki_push_api
```

2. Obtain the library from charmhub:

```shell
charmcraft fetch-lib charms.loki_k8s.v0.loki_push_api
```

3. Import the library and use it in your `src/charm.py`:

```python
from charms.loki_k8s.v0.loki_push_api import LogProxyConsumer
...

class MyOperatorCharm(CharmBase):
    def __init__(self, *args):
        ....
        self._logging = LogProxyConsumer(self, relation_name="logging", log_files=logs_files)
```

4. After deploying Zinc charm relate it with `Grafana Agent`:

```bash
juju relate grafana-agent-k8s:logging-provider zinc-k8s:logging
```


Once the relation is established, Zinc charm can start sending logs to Grafana Agent charm.

### Grafana dashboard

#### This charm

```yaml
provides
  grafana-dashboard:
    interface: grafana_dashboard
```


#### Remote charm

```yaml
requires:
  grafana-dashboard:
    interface: grafana_dashboard
```

Over the `grafana-dashboard` relation using the [`grafana-dashboard`](https://charmhub.io/grafana-k8s/libraries/grafana_dashboard) interface, this Grafana Agent charm also provides meaningful dashboards (placed in `src/grafana_dashboards`) about its metrics to be shown in a [Grafana Charm ](https://charmhub.io/grafana-k8s).

In order to add these dashboards to Grafana all that is required is to relate the two charms in the following way:

```bash
juju relate \
    grafana-agent-k8s:grafana-dashboard \
    grafana-k8s:grafana-dashboard
```

### Self metrics endpoint

#### This charm

```yaml
provides:
  self-metrics-endpoint:
    interface: prometheus_scrape
```

#### Remote charm

```yaml
requires:
  metrics-endpoint:
    interface: prometheus_scrape
```

This Grafana Agent charm may forward information about its metrics endpoint and associated alert rules to a Prometheus charm over the `self-metrics-endpoint` relation using the [`prometheus_scrape`](https://charmhub.io/prometheus-k8s/libraries/prometheus_scrape) interface. In order for these metrics to be aggregated by the remote Prometheus charm all that is required is to relate the two charms as in:


```bash
juju relate \
    grafana-agent-k8s:self-metrics-endpoint \
    prometheus-k8s:metrics-endpoint
```

## Requires

### Logging consumer

#### This charm
```yaml
requires:
  logging-consumer:
    interface: loki_push_api
```

#### Remote charm

```yaml
provides:
  logging:
    interface: loki_push_api
```

[Loki](https://charmhub.io/loki-k8s) receives logs forwarded by this Grafana Agent charm, aggregates and deduplicates them.
Grafana Agent Charmed Operator relates to Loki over the `loki_push_api` interface using the `logging-consumer` relation.


```bash
juju relate grafana-agent-k8s:logging-consumer loki-k8s
```



### Metrics endpoint

#### This charm

```yaml
requires:
  metrics-endpoint:
    interface: prometheus_scrape
```

#### Remote charm

```yaml
provides:
  metrics-endpoint:
    interface: prometheus_scrape
```

Charms may forward information about their metrics endpoints and associated alert rules to the Grafana Agent charm over the `metrics-endpoint` relation using the [`prometheus_scrape`](https://charmhub.io/prometheus-k8s/libraries/prometheus_scrape) interface.

```shell
juju relate grafana-agent-k8s:metrics-endpoint zinc-k8s
```

Charms that seek to provide metrics endpoints and alert rules must do so by using the provided [`prometheus_scrape`](https://charmhub.io/prometheus-k8s/libraries/prometheus_scrape) charm library.  This library, by implementing the `metrics-endpoint` relation, not only ensures that scrape jobs and alert rules are forwarded to Grafana Agent but also that these are updated any time the metrics provider charm is upgraded. For example new alert rules may be added or old ones removed by updating and releasing a new version of the metrics provider charm. While it is safe to update alert rules as desired, care must be taken when updating scrape job specifications as this has the potential to break the continuity of the scraped metrics time series. In particular changing the following keys in the scrape job can break time series continuity
- `job_name`
- `relabel_configs`
- `metrics_relabel_configs`
- Any label set by `static_configs`

Evaluation of alert rules forwarded through the [`prometheus_scrape`](https://charmhub.io/prometheus-k8s/libraries/prometheus_scrape) interface are automatically limited to the charmed application that provided these rules. This ensures that alert rule evaluation is scoped down to the charm providing the rules.

### Send remote write

#### This charm

```yaml
requires:
  send-remote-write:
    interface: prometheus_remote_write
```

#### Remote charm

```yaml
provides:
  receive-remote-write:
    interface: prometheus_remote_write
```


Grafana Agent may forward client charms metrics and associated alert rules (that are received using the `metrics-endpoint` relation) to Prometheus using the [`prometheus_remote_write`](https://charmhub.io/prometheus-k8s/libraries/prometheus_remote_write) interface.
To do that you have to relate Grafana Agent with Prometheus:

```bash
juju relate grafana-agent-k8s:send-remote-write prometheus-k8s
```


Once these relations are established, you can check it by running:

```bash
juju status --relations
```
