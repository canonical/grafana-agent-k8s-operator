# Grafana agent operator for Kubernetes

## Description
[Grafana Agent](https://github.com/grafana/agent) is a telemetry collector for
sending metrics, logs, and trace data to the opinionated Grafana observability
stack.

As a single entry point to the observability stack, the grafana agent charm
brings several conveniences when deployed inside a monitored cluster:

- Charms are related to the grafana agent charm, instead of to prometheus and
  loki individually. In typical deployments this would reduce the number of
  cross-model relations that would have been otherwise needed.
- Conversion from scraping to remote writing: grafana agent would collect
  telemetry inside the cluster network and _push_ it to the COS cluster (via
  `loki_push_api` and `prometheus_remote_write`), which simplifies firewall
  configuration, as only outgoing connections would need to be established.

See [deployment scenarios](https://github.com/canonical/grafana-agent-k8s-operator/blob/main/INTEGRATING.md#deployment-scenarios)
for further detail.

## Usage

Create a Juju model for your operators, say "lma"

```bash
juju add-model lma
```

The Grafana agent may be deployed using the juju command line:

```bash
juju deploy grafana-agent-k8s
```

If required, you can remove the deployment completely:

```bash
juju destroy-model -y lma --no-wait --force --destroy-storage
```

## Relations

Currently supported relations are:


### Required relations

- [prometheus-remote-write](https://github.com/canonical/prometheus-operator/): to be used to push data to a charm exposing the [Prometheus](https://grafana.com/oss/prometheus/) `prometheus_remote_write` API.
- [metrics-endpoint](https://charmhub.io/prometheus-k8s/libraries/prometheus_scrape): to be used to integrate with charms that exposes metrics using the `prometheus_scrape` API.
- [logging](https://charmhub.io/loki-k8s/libraries/loki_push_api): to be used to integrate with a charms that provides a `loki_push_api` interface, for instance the [Loki charmed operator](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/). Through this relation, the Grafana agent charm will send labeled log generated by a workload charm.


### Provides relations:

  - [log_proxy](https://charmhub.io/loki-k8s/libraries/log_proxy): to be used as a log proxy between a workload charm and a charms that provides a `loki_push_api` interface, for instance the [Loki charmed operator](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/). When this relation is established, a [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) binary is injected and configured into the workload charm. This Promtail binary will label and send the logs to this charm which in turn will redirect them to Loki.


## OCI Images

This charm by default uses the `v0.20.1` release of the [grafana/agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/agent)
