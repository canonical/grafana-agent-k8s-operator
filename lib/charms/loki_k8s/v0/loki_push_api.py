r"""## Overview.

This document explains how to use the two principal objects this library provides:

- `LokiPushApiProvider`: This object is meant to be used by any Charmed Operator that needs to
implement the provider side of the `loki_push_api` relation interface. For instance, a Loki charm.
The provider side of the relation represents the server side, to which logs are being pushed.

- `LokiPushApiConsumer`: This object is meant to be used by any Charmed Operator that needs to
send log to Loki by implementing the consumer side of the `loki_push_api` relation interface.
For instance, a Promtail or Grafana agent charm which needs to send logs to Loki.

- `LogProxyConsumer`: This object can be used by any Charmed Operator which needs to
send telemetry, such as logs, to Loki through a Log Proxy by implementing the consumer side of the
`loki_push_api` relation interface.

Filtering logs in Loki is largely performed on the basis of labels. In the Juju ecosystem, Juju
topology labels are used to uniquely identify the workload which generates telemetry like logs.

In order to be able to control the labels on the logs pushed this object adds a Pebble layer
that runs Promtail in the workload container, injecting Juju topology labels into the
logs on the fly.

## LokiPushApiProvider Library Usage

This object may be used by any Charmed Operator which implements the `loki_push_api` interface.
For instance, Loki or Grafana Agent.

For this purposes a charm needs to instantiate the `LokiPushApiProvider` object with one mandatory
and three optional arguments.

- `charm`: A reference to the parent (Loki) charm.

- `relation_name`: The name of the relation that the charm uses to interact
  with its clients, which implement `LokiPushApiConsumer` or `LogProxyConsumer`.

  If provided, this relation name must match a provided relation in metadata.yaml with the
  `loki_push_api` interface.

  Typically `LokiPushApiConsumer` use "logging" as a relation_name and `LogProxyConsumer` use
  "log_proxy".

  The default value of this arguments is "logging".

  An example of this in a `metadata.yaml` file should have the following section:

  ```yaml
  provides:
    logging:
      interface: loki_push_api
  ```

  For example, a Loki charm may instantiate the `LokiPushApiProvider` in its constructor as
  follows:

      from charms.loki_k8s.v0.loki_push_api import LokiPushApiProvider
      from loki_server import LokiServer
      ...

      class LokiOperatorCharm(CharmBase):
          ...

          def __init__(self, *args):
              super().__init__(*args)
              ...
              self._provide_loki()
              ...

          def _provide_loki(self):
              try:
                  version = self._loki_server.version
                  self.loki_provider = LokiPushApiProvider(self)
                  logger.debug("Loki Provider is available. Loki version: %s", version)
              except LokiServerNotReadyError as e:
                  self.unit.status = MaintenanceStatus(str(e))
              except LokiServerError as e:
                  self.unit.status = BlockedStatus(str(e))

  - `port`: Loki Push Api endpoint port. Default value: 3100.
  - `rules_dir`: Directory to store alert rules. Default value: "/loki/rules".


The `LokiPushApiProvider` object has several responsibilities:

1. Set the URL of the Loki Push API in the relation application data bag; the URL
   must be unique to all instances (e.g. using a load balancer).

2. Set the Promtail binary URL (`promtail_binary_zip_url`) so clients that use
   `LogProxyConsumer` object can downloaded and configure it.

3. Process the metadata of the consumer application, provided via the
   "metadata" field of the consumer data bag, which are used to annotate the
   alert rules (see next point). An example for "metadata" is the following:

    {'model': 'loki',
     'model_uuid': '0b7d1071-ded2-4bf5-80a3-10a81aeb1386',
     'application': 'promtail-k8s'
    }

4. Process alert rules set into the relation by the `LokiPushApiConsumer`
   objects, e.g.:

    '{
         "groups": [{
             "name": "loki_0b7d1071-ded2-4bf5-80a3-10a81aeb1386_promtail-k8s_alerts",
             "rules": [{
                 "alert": "HighPercentageError",
                 "expr": "sum(rate({app=\\"foo\\", env=\\"production\\"} |= \\"error\\" [5m]))
                          by (job) \\n  /\\nsum(rate({app=\\"foo\\", env=\\"production\\"}[5m]))
                          by (job)\\n  > 0.05
                          \\n", "for": "10m",
                 "labels": {
                     "severity": "page",
                     "juju_model": "loki",
                     "juju_model_uuid": "0b7d1071-ded2-4bf5-80a3-10a81aeb1386",
                     "juju_application": "promtail-k8s"
                },
                "annotations": {
                    "summary": "High request latency"
               }
             }]
         }]
     }'


Once these alert rules are sent over relation data, the `LokiPushApiProvider` object
stores these files in the directory `/loki/rules` inside the Loki charm container. After
storing alert rules files, the object will check alert rules by querying Loki API
endpoint: [`loki/api/v1/rules`](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/api/#list-rule-groups).
If there are errors with alert rules a `loki_push_api_alert_rules_changed` event will
be emitted with `event.error=True`, in the other hand if there are no error a
`loki_push_api_alert_rules_changed` event will be emitted with `event.error=False`

This events should be observed in the charm that uses `LokiPushApiProvider`:

```python
    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)
        ...
        self.loki_provider = LokiPushApiProvider(self)
        self.framework.observe(
            self.loki_provider.on.loki_push_api_alert_rules_changed,
            self._loki_push_api_alert_rules_changed,
        )

    def _loki_push_api_alert_rules_changed(self, event):
        if event.error:
            self.unit.status = BlockedStatus(event.message)
            return False

        ...

        self.unit.status = ActiveStatus()
```


## LokiPushApiConsumer Library Usage

This Loki charm interacts with its clients using the Loki charm library. Charms
seeking to send log to Loki, must do so using the `LokiPushApiConsumer` object from
this charm library.

For the simplest use cases, using the `LokiPushApiConsumer` object only requires
instantiating it, typically in the constructor of your charm (the one which
sends logs).

```python
from charms.loki_k8s.v0.loki_push_api import LokiPushApiConsumer

class LokiClientCharm(CharmBase):

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)
        ...
        self._loki_consumer = LokiPushApiConsumer(self)
```

The `LokiPushApiConsumer` constructor requires two things:

- A reference to the parent (LokiClientCharm) charm.

- Optionally, the name of the relation that the Loki charm uses to interact
  with its clients. If provided, this relation name must match a required
  relation in metadata.yaml with the `loki_push_api` interface.

  This argument is not required if your metadata.yaml has precisely one
  required relation in metadata.yaml with the `loki_push_api` interface, as the
  lib will automatically resolve the relation name inspecting the using the
  meta information of the charm

Any time the relation between a Loki provider charm and a Loki consumer charm is
established, a `LokiPushApiEndpointJoined` event is fired. In the consumer side
is it possible to observe this event with:

```python

self.framework.observe(
    self._loki_consumer.on.loki_push_api_endpoint_joined,
    self._on_loki_push_api_endpoint_joined,
)
```

Any time there are departures in relations between the consumer charm and Loki
the consumer charm is informed, through a `LokiPushApiEndpointDeparted` event, for instance:

```python
self.framework.observe(
    self._loki_consumer.on.loki_push_api_endpoint_departed,
    self._on_loki_push_api_endpoint_departed,
)
```

The consumer charm can then choose to update its configuration in both situations.

## LogProxyConsumer Library Usage

Let's say that we have a workload charm that produces logs and we need to send those logs to a
workload implementing the `loki_push_api` interface, such as `Loki` or `Grafana Agent`.

Adopting this object in a Charmed Operator consist of two steps:

1. Use the `LogProxyConsumer` class by instanting it in the `__init__` method of the charmed
   operator. There are two ways to get logs in to promtail. You can give it a list of files to read
   or you can write to it using the syslog protocol.

   For example:

   ```python
   from charms.loki_k8s.v0.loki_push_api import LogProxyConsumer

   ...

       def __init__(self, *args):
           ...
           self._log_proxy = LogProxyConsumer(
               charm=self, log_files=LOG_FILES, container_name=PEER, enable_syslog=True
           )

           self.framework.observe(
               self._log_proxy.on.promtail_digest_error,
               self._promtail_error,
           )

       def _promtail_error(self, event):
           logger.error(event.message)
           self.unit.status = BlockedStatus(event.message)
   ```

   Any time the relation between a provider charm and a LogProxy consumer charm is
   established, a `LogProxyEndpointJoined` event is fired. In the consumer side is it
   possible to observe this event with:

   ```python

   self.framework.observe(
       self._log_proxy.on.log_proxy_endpoint_joined,
       self._on_log_proxy_endpoint_joined,
   )
   ```

   Any time there are departures in relations between the consumer charm and the provider
   the consumer charm is informed, through a `LogProxyEndpointDeparted` event, for instance:

   ```python
   self.framework.observe(
       self._log_proxy.on.log_proxy_endpoint_departed,
       self._on_log_proxy_endpoint_departed,
   )
   ```

   The consumer charm can then choose to update its configuration in both situations.

   Note that:

   - `LOG_FILES` is a `list` containing the log files we want to send to `Loki` or
   `Grafana Agent`, for instance:

   ```python
   LOG_FILES = [
       "/var/log/apache2/access.log",
       "/var/log/alternatives.log",
   ]
   ```

   - `container_name` is the name of the container in which the application is running.
      If in the Pod there is only one container, this argument can be omitted.

   - You can configure your syslog software using `localhost` as the address and the method
     `LogProxyConsumer.syslog_port` to get the port, or, alternatively, if you are using rsyslog
     you may use the method `LogProxyConsumer.rsyslog_config()`.

2. Modify the `metadata.yaml` file to add:

   - The `log-proxy` relation in the `requires` section:
     ```yaml
     requires:
       log-proxy:
         interface: loki_push_api
         optional: true
     ```

Once the library is implemented in a Charmed Operator and a relation is established with
the charm that implements the `loki_push_api` interface, the library will inject a
Pebble layer that runs Promtail in the workload container to send logs.

By default, the promtail binary injected into the container will be downloaded from the internet.
If, for any reason, the container has limited network access, you may allow charm administrators
to provide their own promtail binary at runtime by adding the following snippet to your charm
metadata:

```yaml
resources:
  promtail-bin:
      type: file
      description: Promtail binary for logging
      filename: promtail-linux-amd64
```

Which would then allow operators to deploy the charm this way:

```
juju deploy \
    ./your_charm.charm \
    --resource promtail-bin=/tmp/promtail-linux-amd64
```

The object can emit a `PromtailDigestError` event:

- Promtail binary cannot be downloaded.
- The sha256 sum mismatch for promtail binary.

The object can raise a `ContainerNotFoundError` event:

- No `container_name` parameter has been specified and the Pod has more than 1 container.

These can be monitored via the PromtailDigestError events via:

```python
   self.framework.observe(
       self._loki_consumer.on.promtail_digest_error,
       self._promtail_error,
   )

   def _promtail_error(self, event):
       logger.error(msg)
       self.unit.status = BlockedStatus(event.message)
    )
```

## Alerting Rules

This charm library also supports gathering alerting rules from all related Loki client
charms and enabling corresponding alerts within the Loki charm. Alert rules are
automatically gathered by `LokiPushApiConsumer` object from a directory conventionally
named `loki_alert_rules`.

This directory must reside at the top level in the `src` folder of the
consumer charm. Each file in this directory is assumed to be a single alert rule
in YAML format. The file name must have the `.rule` extension.
The format of this alert rule conforms to the
[Loki docs](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/rules/#alerting-rules).

An example of the contents of one such file is shown below.

```yaml
alert: HighPercentageError
expr: |
  sum(rate({%%juju_topology%%} |= "error" [5m])) by (job)
    /
  sum(rate({%%juju_topology%%}[5m])) by (job)
    > 0.05
for: 10m
labels:
    severity: page
annotations:
    summary: High request latency

```

It is **critical** to use the `%%juju_topology%%` filter in the expression for the alert
rule shown above. This filter is a stub that is automatically replaced by the
`LokiPushApiConsumer` following Loki Client's Juju topology (application, model and its
UUID). Such a topology filter is essential to ensure that alert rules submitted by one
provider charm generates alerts only for that same charm.

The Loki charm may be related to multiple Loki client charms. Without this, filter
rules submitted by one provider charm will also result in corresponding alerts for other
provider charms. Hence every alert rule expression must include such a topology filter stub.

Gathering alert rules and generating rule files within the Loki charm is easily done using
the `alerts()` method of `LokiPushApiProvider`. Alerts generated by Loki will automatically
include Juju topology labels in the alerts. These labels indicate the source of the alert.

The following labels are automatically added to every alert

- `juju_model`
- `juju_model_uuid`
- `juju_application`


Whether alert rules files does not contain the keys `alert` or `expr` or there is no alert
rules file in `alert_rules_path` a `loki_push_api_alert_rules_error` event is emitted.

To handle these situations the event must be observed in the `LokiClientCharm` charm.py file:

```python
class LokiClientCharm(CharmBase):

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)
        ...
        self._loki_consumer = LokiPushApiConsumer(self)

        self.framework.observe(
            self._loki_consumer.on.loki_push_api_alert_rules_error,
            self._alert_rules_error
        )

    def _alert_rules_error(self, event):
        self.unit.status = BlockedStatus(event.message)
```

## Relation Data

The Loki charm uses both application and unit relation data to obtain information regarding
Loki Push API and alert rules.

Units of consumer charm send their alert rules over app relation data using the `alert_rules`
key.

    The `LogProxyConsumer` object provides a method for attaching `promtail` to
    a workload in order to generate structured logging data from applications

    The `LogProxyConsumer` can be instantiated as follows:

        self._log_proxy_consumer = LogProxyConsumer(self, log_files=["/var/log/messages"])

    Args:
        charm: a `CharmBase` object that manages this `LokiPushApiConsumer` object.
            Typically, this is `self` in the instantiating class.
        log_files: a list of log files to monitor with Promtail.
        relation_name: the string name of the relation interface to look up.
            If `charm` has exactly one relation with this interface, the relation's
            name is returned. If none or multiple relations with the provided interface
            are found, this method will raise either an exception of type
            NoRelationWithInterfaceFoundError or MultipleRelationsWithInterfaceFoundError,
            respectively.
        enable_syslog: Whether to enable syslog integration.
        syslog_port: The port syslog is attached to.
        alert_rules_path: an optional path for the location of alert rules
            files. Defaults to "./src/loki_alert_rules",
            resolved from the directory hosting the charm entry file.
            The alert rules are automatically updated on charm upgrade.
        recursive: Whether to scan for rule files recursively.
        container_name: An optional container name to inject the payload into.

    Raises:
        RelationNotFoundError: If there is no relation in the charm's metadata.yaml
            with the same name as provided via `relation_name` argument.
        RelationInterfaceMismatchError: The relation with the same name as provided
            via `relation_name` argument does not have the `loki_push_api` relation
            interface.
        RelationRoleMismatchError: If the relation with the same name as provided
