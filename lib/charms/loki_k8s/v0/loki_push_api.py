r"""## Overview.

This document explains how to use the four principal objects this library provides:


- `LokiPushApiProvider`: This object is ment to be used by any charmed operator that needs to
implement the provider side of the `loki_push_api` relation interface.
For instance a Loki charm.

- `LokiPushApiConsumer`: This object is ment to be used by any charmed operator that needs to
send log to Loki by implementing the consumer side of the `loki_push_api` relation interface.
For instance a Promtail or Grafana agent charm that needs to send logs to Loki.

- `LogProxyProvider`: This object is ment to be used by any charmed operator that needs to act
as a Log Proxy to Loki by implementing the provider side of `log_proxy` relation interface.
For instance a Grafana agent or Promtail charmed operator that receives logs from a workload
and forward them to Loki.

- `LogProxyConsumer`: This object is ment to be used by any K8s charmed operator that needs to
send log to Loki through a Log Proxy by implementing the consumer side of `log_proxy` relation
interface.
Filtering logs in Loki is largely performed on the basis of labels.
In the Juju ecosystem, Juju topology labels are used to uniquely identify the workload that
generates telemetry like logs.
In order to be able to control the labels on the logs pushedm this object injects a Pebble layer
that runs Promtail in the worload container, injecting Juju topology labels into the
logs on the fly.



## LokiPushApiProvider Library Usage

This object may be used by Loki charms to manage relations
with their clients.
For this purposes a Loki charm needs to instantiate the
`LokiPushApiProvider` object providing it with two pieces
of information:

- A reference to the parent (Loki) charm.

- Optionally, the name of the relation that the Loki charm uses to interact
  with its clients. If provided, this relation name must match a provided
  relation in metadata.yaml with the `loki_push_api` interface.
  This argument is not required if your metadata.yaml has precisely one
  provided relation in metadata.yaml with the `loki_push_api` interface, as the
  lib will automatically resolve the relation name inspecting the using the
  meta information of the charm.

An example of this in `metadata.yaml` file should have the following section:

    provides:
      logging:
        interface: loki_push_api

If you would like to use relation name other than `logging`,
you will need to specify the relation name via the `relation_name`
argument when instantiating the :class:`LokiPushApiProvider` object.
However, it is strongly advised to keep the the default relation name,
so that people deploying your charm will have a consistent experience
with all other charms that provide Loki Push API.

For example a Loki charm may instantiate the
`LokiPushApiProvider` in its constructor as follows

    from charms.loki_k8s.v0.loki_push_api import LokiPushApiProvider
    from loki_server import LokiServer
    ...

    class LokiOperatorCharm(CharmBase):
        ...

        def __init__(self, *args):
            super().__init__(*args)
            ...
            self._provide_loki()
            ...

        def _provide_loki(self):
            try:
                version = self._loki_server.version
                self.loki_provider = LokiPushApiProvider(self)
                logger.debug("Loki Provider is available. Loki version: %s", version)
            except LokiServerNotReadyError as e:
                self.unit.status = MaintenanceStatus(str(e))
            except LokiServerError as e:
                self.unit.status = BlockedStatus(str(e))


The `LokiPushApiProvider` object has two main responsabilities:

1.- Be in charge of setting the Loki Push API Address into
relation data so clients can use it to send logs. Every time a unit joins
a relation: `$ juju add-relation loki-k8s loki-client-k8s` the object sets:

    event.relation.data[self.charm.unit]["data"] = self._loki_push_api

Where `self._loki_push_api` is: `http://<LOKI_UNIT_IP>:<LOKI_PORT>/loki/api/v1/push`


2.- Every time a Loki client unit joins a relation set its metadata and
[alerts rules](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/rules/#alerting-rules) to
relation data.

The metadata is stored in relation data:

    event.relation.data[self._charm.app]["metadata"] = json.dumps(self._scrape_metadata)

For instance the metadata has the following data:

    {'model': 'loki',
     'model_uuid': '0b7d1071-ded2-4bf5-80a3-10a81aeb1386',
     'application': 'promtail-k8s'
    }

About alert rules, they are stored in relation data:

    if alert_groups := self._labeled_alert_groups:
        event.relation.data[self._charm.app]["alert_rules"] = json.dumps(
            {"groups": alert_groups}
        )


And has this aspect:

    '{
         "groups": [{
             "name": "loki_0b7d1071-ded2-4bf5-80a3-10a81aeb1386_promtail-k8s_alerts",
             "rules": [{
                 "alert": "HighPercentageError",
                 "expr": "sum(rate({app=\\"foo\\", env=\\"production\\"} |= \\"error\\" [5m]))
                          by (job) \\n  /\\nsum(rate({app=\\"foo\\", env=\\"production\\"}[5m]))
                          by (job)\\n  > 0.05
                          \\n", "for": "10m",
                 "labels": {
                     "severity": "page",
                     "juju_model": "loki",
                     "juju_model_uuid": "0b7d1071-ded2-4bf5-80a3-10a81aeb1386",
                     "juju_application": "promtail-k8s"
                },
                "annotations": {
                    "summary": "High request latency"
               }
             }]
         }]
     }'


Once these alert rules are sent over relation data, the `LokiPushApiProvider` object
stores these files in the directory `/loki/rules` inside the Loki charm container.


## LokiPushApiConsumer Library Usage

This Loki charm interacts with its clients using the Loki
charm library. Charms seeking to send log to Loki,
must do so using the `LokiPushApiConsumer` object from this charm library.
For the simplest use cases, using the `LokiPushApiConsumer` object only requires
instantiating it, typically in the constructor of your charm (the one which
sends logs).

    from charms.loki_k8s.v0.loki_push_api import LokiPushApiConsumer

    class LokiClientCharm(CharmBase):

        def __init__(self, *args):
            super().__init__(*args)
            ...
            self._loki_consumer = LokiPushApiConsumer(self)


The `LokiPushApiConsumer` constructor requires two things:

- A reference to the parent (LokiClientCharm) charm.

- Optionally, the name of the relation that the Loki charm uses to interact
  with its clients. If provided, this relation name must match a required
  relation in metadata.yaml with the `loki_push_api` interface.
  This argument is not required if your metadata.yaml has precisely one
  required relation in metadata.yaml with the `loki_push_api` interface, as the
  lib will automatically resolve the relation name inspecting the using the
  meta information of the charm

Anytime the relation between a Loki provider charm and a Loki consumer charm is
established a `LokiPushApiEndpointJoined` event is fired. In the consumer side
is it possible to observe this event with:

```python

self.framework.observe(
    self._loki_consumer.on.loki_push_api_endpoint_joined,
    self._on_loki_push_api_endpoint_joined,
)
```

Anytime there are departures in relations between the consumer charm and Loki
the consumer charm is informed, through a `LokiPushApiEndpointDeparted` event, for instance:

```python
self.framework.observe(
    self._loki_consumer.on.loki_push_api_endpoint_departed,
    self._on_loki_push_api_endpoint_departed,
)
```

The consumer charm can then choose to update its configuration in both situations.


## Alerting Rules

This charm library also supports gathering alerting rules from all
related Loki clients charms and enabling corresponding alerts within the
Loki charm. Alert rules are automatically gathered by `LokiPushApiConsumer` object
from a directory conventionally named `loki_alert_rules`.
This directory must reside at the top level in the `src` folder of the
consumer charm. Each file in this directory is assumed to be a single alert rule
in YAML format. The file name must have the `.rule` extension.
The format of this alert rule conforms to the
[Loki docs](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/rules/#alerting-rules).
An example of the contents of one such file is shown below.

```
alert: HighPercentageError
expr: |
  sum(rate({%%juju_topology%%} |= "error" [5m])) by (job)
    /
  sum(rate({%%juju_topology%%}[5m])) by (job)
    > 0.05
for: 10m
labels:
    severity: page
annotations:
    summary: High request latency

```

It is **critical** to use the `%%juju_topology%%` filter in the
expression for the alert rule shown above. This filter is a stub that
is automatically replaced by the `LokiPushApiConsumer` following Loki Client's Juju
topology (application, model and its UUID). Such a topology filter is
essential to ensure that alert rules submitted by one provider charm
generates alerts only for that same charm.  The Loki charm may
be related to multiple Loki client charms. Without this, filter
rules submitted by one provider charm will also result in
corresponding alerts for other provider charms. Hence every alert rule
expression must include such a topology filter stub.

Gathering alert rules and generating rule files within the Loki
charm is easily done using the `alerts()` method of
`LokiPushApiProvider`. Alerts generated by Loki will
automatically include Juju topology labels in the alerts. These labels
indicate the source of the alert. The following lables are
automatically added to every alert

- `juju_model`
- `juju_model_uuid`
- `juju_application`

## Relation Data

The Loki charm uses both application and unit relation data to
obtain information regarding Loki Push API and alert rules.

Units of consumer charm send their alert rules over app relation
data using the `alert_rules` key.


## LogProxyConsumer Library Usage

Let's say that we have a workload charm that produce logs and we need to send those logs to a
workload implementing the `loki_push_api` interface, like `Loki` or `Grafana Agent`.

Adopting this object in a charmed operator consist of two steps:


1. Use the `LogProxyConsumer` class by instanting it in the `__init__` method of the
   charmed operator:

   ```python
   from charms.grafana_agent_k8s.v0.grafana_agent import LogProxyConsumer, PromtailDigestError

   ...

       def __init__(self, *args):
           ...
           try:
               self._log_proxy = LogProxyConsumer(
                   charm=self, log_files=LOG_FILES, container_name=PEER
               )
           except PromtailDigestError as e:
               msg = str(e)
               logger.error(msg)
               self.unit.status = BlockedStatus(msg)
   ```

   Note that:

   - `LOG_FILES` is a `list` containing the log files we want to send to `Loki` or
   `Grafana Agent`, for instance:

   ```python
   LOG_FILES = [
       "/var/log/apache2/access.log",
       "/var/log/alternatives.log",
   ]
   ```

   - `container_name` is the name of the container in which the application is running.
      If in the Pod there is only one container, this argument can be avoided.

2. Modify the `metadata.yaml` file to add:

   - The `log_proxy` relation in the `requires` section:
     ```yaml
     requires:
       log_proxy:
         interface: loki_push_api
         optional: true
     ```

Once the library is implemented in a charmed operator and a relation is established with
the charm that implemets the `loki_push_api` interface, the library will inject a
Pebble layer that runs Promtail in the worload container to send logs.

The object can raise a `PromtailDigestError` when:

- Promtail binary cannot be downloaded.
- No `container_name` parameter has been specified and the Pod has more than 1 container.
- The sha256 sum mismatch for promtail binary.

that's why in the above example, the instanciation is made in a `try/except` block
to handle these situations conveniently.


## LogProxyProvider Library Usage

This object is ment to be used by any charmed operator that needs to act
as a Log Proxy to Loki by implementing the provider side of `log_proxy` relation interface.
For instance a Grafana agent or Promtail charmed operator that receives logs from a workload
and forward them to Loki.

Adopting this object in a charmed operator consist of two steps:

1. Use the `LogProxyProvider` class by instanting it in the `__init__` method of the
   charmed operator:

   ```python
   from charms.loki_k8s.v0.loki_push_api import LogProxyProvider

   ...

       def __init__(self, *args):
           ...
           self._log_proxy = LogProxyProvider(self)
   ```

2. Modify the `metadata.yaml` file to add:

   - The `log_proxy` relation in the `provider` section:
     ```yaml
     provides:
       log_proxy:
         interface: loki_push_api
     ```
