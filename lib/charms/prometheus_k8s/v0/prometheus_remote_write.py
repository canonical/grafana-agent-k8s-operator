    """API that manages a required `prometheus_remote_write` relation.

    The `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` is intended to be used by charms that need to push data to
    other charms over the Prometheus remote_write API.

    The `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` object can be instantiated as follows in your charm:

    ```
    from charms.prometheus_k8s.v0.prometheus_remote_write import PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer

    def __init__(self, *args):
        ...
        self.remote_write_consumer = PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer(self)
        ...
    ```

    The `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` assumes that, in the `metadata.yaml` of your charm,
    you declare a required relation as follows:

    ```
    requires:
        prometheus-remote-write:  # Relation name
            interface: prometheus_remote_write  # Relation interface
    ```

    The charmed operator uses the `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` as follows:

    ```
    def __init__(self, *args):
        ...
        self.remote_write_consumer = PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer(self)
        ...

        self.framework.observe(
            self.remote_write_consumer.on.endpoints_changed,
            _handle_endpoints_changed,
        )
    ```

    Then, inside the logic of `_handle_endpoints_changed`, the updated endpoint list is
    retrieved with with:

    ```
    self.remote_write_consumer.endpoints
    ```

    which returns a dictionary structured like the Prometheus configuration object (see
    https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write).

    About the name of the relation managed by this library: technically, you *could* change
    the relation name, `prometheus-remote-write`, but that requires you to provide the new
    relation name to the `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` via the `relation_name` constructor
    argument. (The relation interface, on the other hand, is immutable and, if you were to change
    it, your charm would not be able to relate with other charms using the right relation
    interface. The library prevents you from doing that by raising an exception.) In any case, it
    is strongly discouraged to change the relation name: having consistent relation names across
    charms that do similar things is a very good thing for the people that will use your charm.
    The one exception to the rule above, is if you charm needs to both consume and provide a
    relation using the `prometheus_remote_write` interface, in which case changing the relation
    name to differentiate between "incoming" and "outgoing" remote write interactions is necessary.

    It is also possible to specify alert rules. By default, this library will look
    into the `<charm_parent_dir>/prometheus_alert_rules`, which in standard charm
    layouts resolves to `src/prometheus_alert_rules`. Each alert rule goes into a
    separate `*.rule` file. If the syntax of a rule is invalid,
    the  `MetricsEndpointProvider` logs an error and does not load the particular
    rule.

    To avoid false positives and negatives in the evaluation of your alert rules,
    you must always add the `%%juju_topology%%` token as label filters in the
    PromQL expression, e.g.:

        alert: UnitUnavailable
        expr: up{%%juju_topology%%} < 1
        for: 0m
        labels:
            severity: critical
        annotations:
            summary: Unit {{ $labels.juju_model }}/{{ $labels.juju_unit }} unavailable
            description: >
            The unit {{ $labels.juju_model }} {{ $labels.juju_unit }} is unavailable

    The `%%juju_topology%%` token will be replaced with label filters ensuring that
    the only timeseries evaluated are those scraped from this charm, and no other.
    Failing to ensure that the `%%juju_topology%%` token is applied to each and every
    of the queries timeseries will lead to unpredictable alert rule evaluation
    if your charm is deployed multiple times and various of its instances are
    monitored by the same Prometheus.

        A Prometheus alert rules file consists of a list of "groups". Each
